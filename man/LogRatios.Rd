\title{Log Ratios of Measurements}
\usage{
LogRatios(
  data,
  ref = referenceCombi,
  identifiers = c("TAX", "EL"),
  refMeasuresName = "Measure",
  refValuesName = "Standard",
  thesaurusSet = zoologThesaurus,
  joinCategories = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe with the input measurements.}

\item{ref}{A dataframe including the measurement values used as references.
The default \code{ref = referenceCombi} provided as package \pkg{zoolog} data.}

\item{identifiers}{A vector of column names in \code{ref} identifying
a type of bone. By default \code{identifiers = c("TAX", "EL")}.}

\item{refMeasuresName}{The column name in \code{ref} identifying the type of
bone measurement.}

\item{refValuesName}{The column name in \code{ref} giving the measurement
value.}

\item{thesaurusSet}{A thesaurus allowing datasets with different nomenclatures
to be merged. By default \code{thesaurusSet = zoologThesaurus}.}

\item{joinCategories}{A list of named character vectors. Each vector is named
by a category in the reference and includes a set of categories in the data
for which to compute the log ratios with respect to that reference.
When \code{NULL} (default) no grouping is considered.}
}
\value{
A dataframe including the input dataframe and additional columns, one
for each extracted log ratio for each relevant measurement in the reference.
The name of the added columns are constructed by prefixing each measurement by
the internal variable \code{logPrefix}.
}
\description{
Function to compute the log ratios of the measurements
relative to standard reference values.
By default a reference is provided with the package.
}
\details{
The \code{identifiers} are expected to determine corresponding
columns in both data and reference. Each value in these columns identifies
the type of bone. By default this is determined by a taxon and a bone
element. For any case in the data, the log ratios are computed with respect
to the reference values in the same bone type. If the reference does not
include that bone type, the corresponding log ratios are set to \code{NA}.

For some applications it can be interesting to group some set of bone types
into the same reference category to compute the log ratios. The parameter
\code{joinCategories} allows this grouping. \code{joinCategories} must be a
list of named vectors, each including the set of categories in the data
which should be mapped to the reference category given by its name.

This can be applied to group different species into a single
reference species. For instance \emph{sheep}, \emph{capra}, and doubtful
cases between both (\emph{sheep/capra}), can be grouped and assigned to the
same reference for \emph{sheep}, by setting
\code{joinCategories = list(sheep = c("sheep", "capra", "oc"))}.
Similarly, it can be applied to group
different bone elements into a single reference.

Note that the \code{joinCategories} option does not remove the distinction
between the different bone types in the data, just indicates that for any
of them the log ratios must be computed from the same reference.

\examples{
## Read an example dataset:
dataFile <- system.file("extdata", "dataValenzuelaLamas2008.csv.gz",
                        package="zoolog")
dataExample <- read.csv2(dataFile,
                         quote = "\"", na = "", header = TRUE,
                         fileEncoding = "UTF-8")
## We can observe the first lines (excluding some columns for visibility):
head(dataExample)[, -c(6:20,32:63)]
## We keep now only the first 1000 cases to make the example run sufficiently
## fast. Avoid this step if you want to process the full example dataset.
dataExample <- dataExample[1:1000, ]

## Compute the log-ratios with respect to the default reference in the
## package zoolog:
dataExampleWithLogs <- LogRatios(dataExample)
## The output data frame include new columns with the log-ratios of the
## present measurements, in both data and reference, with a "log" prefix:
head(dataExampleWithLogs)[, -c(6:20,32:63)]

## Read a different reference:
referenceFile <- system.file("extdata", "referenceBasel.csv",
                             package="zoolog")
userReferenceLogs <- read.csv2(referenceFile,
                               quote = "\"", na = "", header = TRUE,
                               fileEncoding = "UTF-8")
## Compute the log-ratios with respect to this alternative reference:
dataExampleWithLogs2 <- LogRatios(dataExample, ref = userReferenceLogs)
head(dataExampleWithLogs2)[, -c(6:20,32:63)]

## We can be interested in including the first phalanges without
## identification as posterior or anterior, to compute the log ratios with
## respect to the anterior first phalanges.
categoriesP1 <- list('P1 ant' = c("P1 ant", "P1"))
dataExampleWithLogs3 <- LogRatios(dataExample,
                                  joinCategories = categoriesP1)
head(dataExampleWithLogs3)[, -c(6:20,32:63)]
}
