\usage{
LogRatios(
  data,
  ref = reference$Combi,
  identifiers = c("TAX", "EL"),
  refMeasuresName = "Measure",
  refValuesName = "Standard",
  thesaurusSet = zoologThesaurus,
  joinCategories = NULL,
  mergedMeasures = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe with the input measurements.}

\item{ref}{A dataframe including the measurement values used as references.
The default \code{ref = reference$Combi} provided as package \pkg{zoolog} data.}

\item{identifiers}{A vector of column names in \code{ref} identifying
a type of bone. By default \code{identifiers = c("TAX", "EL")}.}

\item{refMeasuresName}{The column name in \code{ref} identifying the type of
bone measurement.}

\item{refValuesName}{The column name in \code{ref} giving the measurement
value.}

\item{thesaurusSet}{A thesaurus allowing datasets with different nomenclatures
to be merged. By default \code{thesaurusSet = zoologThesaurus}.}

\item{joinCategories}{A list of named character vectors. Each vector is named
by a category in the reference and includes a set of categories in the data
for which to compute the log ratios with respect to that reference.
When \code{NULL} (default) no grouping is considered.}

\item{mergedMeasures}{A list of character vectors or a single character vector.
Each vector identifies a set of measures that the data presents merged in the
same column, named as any of them. This practice only makes sense if only one
of the measures can appear in each bone element.}
}
\value{
A dataframe including the input dataframe and additional columns, one
for each extracted log ratio for each relevant measurement in the reference.
The name of the added columns are constructed by prefixing each measurement by
the internal variable \code{logPrefix}.

If the input dataframe includes additional S3 classes (such as "tbl_df"),
they are also passed to the output.
}
\description{
Function to compute the (base 10) log ratios of the measurements
relative to standard reference values.
By default a reference is provided with the package.
}
\details{
Each log ratio is defined as the decimal logarithm of the ratio of the
variable of interest to a corresponding reference value.

The \code{identifiers} are expected to determine corresponding
columns in both data and reference. Each value in these columns identifies
the type of bone. By default this is determined by a taxon and a bone
element. For any case in the data, the log ratios are computed with respect
to the reference values in the same bone type. If the reference does not
include that bone type, the corresponding log ratios are set to \code{NA}.

For some applications it can be interesting to group some set of bone types
into the same reference category to compute the log ratios. The parameter
\code{joinCategories} allows this grouping. \code{joinCategories} must be a
list of named vectors, each including the set of categories in the data
which should be mapped to the reference category given by its name.

This can be applied to group different species into a single
reference species. For instance \emph{sheep}, \emph{capra}, and doubtful
cases between both (\emph{sheep/capra}), can be grouped and matched to the
same reference for \emph{sheep}, by setting
\code{joinCategories = list(sheep = c("sheep", "capra", "oc"))}.
Similarly, it can be applied to group
different bone elements into a single reference (see the example below for
undetermined phalanges).

Note that the \code{joinCategories} option does not remove the distinction
between the different bone types in the data, just indicates that for any
of them the log ratios must be computed from the same reference.

There are some measures that are restricted to a subset of bones. For
instance, \emph{GLl} is only relevant for the \emph{astragalus}, while
\emph{GL} is not applicable to it. Thus, there cannot be any ambiguity
between both measures since they can be identified by the bone element.
This justifies that some users have simplified datasets where a single column
records indistinctly \emph{GL} or \emph{GLl}. The optional parameter
\code{mergedMeasures} facilitates the processing of this type of simplified
dataset. For the alluded example,
\code{mergedMeasures = list(c("GL", "GLl"))} automatically selects, for each
bone element, the corresponding measure present in the reference.

Observe that if \code{mergedMeasures} is set to non mutually exclusive
measures, the behaviour is unpredictable.

\examples{
## Read an example dataset:
dataFile <- system.file("extdata", "dataValenzuelaLamas2008.csv.gz",
                        package="zoolog")
dataExample <- utils::read.csv2(dataFile,
                                na.strings = "",
                                encoding = "UTF-8",
                                stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
## For illustration purposes we keep now only a subset of cases to make
## the example run sufficiently fast.
## Avoid this step if you want to process the full example dataset.
dataExample <- dataExample[145:1000, ]
## We can observe the first lines (excluding some columns for visibility):
head(dataExample)[, -c(6:20,32:64)]

## Compute the log-ratios with respect to the default reference in the
## package zoolog:
dataExampleWithLogs <- LogRatios(dataExample)
## The output data frame include new columns with the log-ratios of the
## present measurements, in both data and reference, with a "log" prefix:
head(dataExampleWithLogs)[, -c(6:20,32:64)]

## Compute the log-ratios with respect to a different reference:
dataExampleWithLogs2 <- LogRatios(dataExample, ref = reference$Basel)
head(dataExampleWithLogs2)[, -c(6:20,32:64)]

## Define an altenative reference combining differently the references'
## database:
refComb <- list(cattle = "Nieto", sheep = "Davis", Goat = "Clutton",
                pig = "Albarella", redDeer = "Basel")
userReference <- AssembleReference(refComb)
## Compute the log-ratios with respect to this alternative reference:
dataExampleWithLogs3 <- LogRatios(dataExample, ref = userReference)

## We can be interested in including the first and second phalanges without
## anterior-posterior identification ("phal 1" and "phal 2"), by computing
## their log ratios with respect to the reference of the corresponding
## anterior first phalanges ("phal 1 ant" and "phal 2 ant", respectively).
## For this we use the optional argument joinCategories:
categoriesPhalAnt <- list('phal 1 ant' = c("phal 1 ant", "phal 1"),
                          'phal 2 ant' = c("phal 2 ant", "phal 2"))
dataExampleWithLogs4 <- LogRatios(dataExample,
                                  joinCategories = categoriesPhalAnt)
head(dataExampleWithLogs4)[, -c(6:20,32:64)]
}
