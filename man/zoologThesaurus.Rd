\title{Thesaurus Set for zoolog}
\format{
A thesaurus set is a list of thesauri with additional attributes:
\describe{
\item{names}{Character vector with the name of each thesaurus.}
\item{applyToColNames}{Logical vector. Should the thesaurus be applied to
the column names of the data frame?}
\item{applyToColValues}{Logical vector. Should the thesaurus be applied to
the values in the corresponding column of the data frame?}
\item{filename}{Character vector with the source file of each thesaurus.}
}

The examples below show the list of four thesauri included in the provided
\code{zoologThesurus}.

Each thesaurus is a data frame also with additional attributes. Each column
of the data frame is a category of names with equivalent meaning in the
intended application. The column name identifies the category and is used
as the standard when applying \code{\link{StandardizeNomenclature}}.

The names in each column (category) must not be included in any other
column, since this would make the thesaurus ambiguous (see
\code{\link{ThesaurusAmbiguity}}).

Each thesaurus has the following attributes:
\describe{
\item{names}{The standard name for the categories.}
\item{class}{"data.frame"}
\item{row.names}{Irrelevant}
\item{caseSensitive}{Logical. Should the names in the thesaurus be
considered case-sensitive?}
\item{accentSensitive}{Logical. Should the names in the thesaurus be
differentiated by the presence of accent marks?}
}

The examples below show the content and characteristics of the first
thesaurus in \code{zoologThesurus}.

\description{
The thesaurus set defined for the package \code{zoolog}.
This is used to make the methods robust to different nomenclatures used
in datasets created by different authors. The user can also use other
thesaurus sets, or can modify the provided thesaurus set (see
\code{\link{Thesaurus Management}} and \code{\link{Thesaurus Reader/Writer}}).
