\title{Taxa included in a taxonomical category}
\usage{
GetTaxaIn(groupName)
}
\arguments{
\item{groupName}{A name of any of the taxonomical groups at any level from
taxon to family.}
}
\value{
A character vector including the taxa included in the requested
\code{groupName}.
}
\description{
Function to obtain the set of taxa included in a particular taxonomical
group according to the \code{\link{zoologTaxonomy}}.
}
\examples{
## Get taxa of genus Sus:
GetTaxaIn("Sus")

## Get taxa of family Bovidae:
GetTaxaIn("Bovidae")

## Use the function to join categories for computing log-ratios.
## For this, we read an example dataset:
dataFile <- system.file("extdata", "dataValenzuelaLamas2008.csv.gz",
                        package="zoolog")
dataExample <- utils::read.csv2(dataFile,
                                na.strings = "",
                                encoding = "UTF-8",
                                stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
## We illustrate with a subset of cases to make the example run
## sufficiently fast:
dataExample <- dataExample[160:1000, ]
## Compute the log-ratios joining all taxa from tribe \emph{Caprini}
## to use the reference of \emph{Ovis aries}:
categoriesCaprini <- list('Ovis aries' = c(GetTaxaIn("Caprini"), "Caprine"))
dataExampleWithLogs <- LogRatios(dataExample,
                                 joinCategories = categoriesCaprini)
}
